A simple PDF viewer using Mozillas PDF.js lib. This is a very simple project just to try my hands on the lib.

Unfortunately this API has been depreciated and I couldnt find the solution ( truth be told, I didn't think spending more time to find a solution to a depreciated 
API just to test my hands on it was justified ).

So this code still shows you the PDF but the NEXT and PREV page buttons dont work.

Thus I have removed this from being hosted.

Check out my other projects. Thanks !!
